# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This project contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Rust (a bit late, I started coding them on 31st December :P).

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun with the programming community.

## Project Structure

Each day's challenge will be in its own directory under the `src` folder. For example:

```
src/
├── days/
│   ├── day01.rs
│   └── day02.rs
...
```

## Input Files

The input files for each day's challenge are stored in the `inputs` folder. Each file is named according to the day of the challenge. For example:

```
inputs/
├── day01.txt
├── day02.txt
...
```

## Running the Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day, use `cargo run` and provide the day as an argument (prefixing it with 0 in case of 1 digit):

```sh
cargo run 01
```
